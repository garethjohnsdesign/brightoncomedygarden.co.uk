description: The amazing William Bacon has consolidated 15 years experience as a chef, with 7 of those years spent travelling the world, into founding Kurbside Kitchen, a wonderful food truck specialising in German frankfurters with gourmet toppings, low and slow cooked meats, Cajun and sweet potato fries and super-food salads. William is particularly proud of Kurbside’s quite frankly ridiculously delicious gourmet hot dogs. They’re made with high quality beef, pork, chorizo or tofu with natural skin to ensure the perfect snap and are served inside a brioche sub, baked daily by their local artisan baker.
